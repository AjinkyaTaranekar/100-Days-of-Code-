    "# Introduction to R Programming\n",
    "R is one of the most popular analytics tool. But apart from being used for analytics, R is also a programming language. With its growth in the IT industry, there is a booming demand for skilled or certified Data Scientists with an understanding of R as both, a data analytics tool and a programming language. In this Notebook, I will help you understand the various fundamentals of R programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "# we will understand the below core concepts of R Programming in the following sequence:\n",

    "# Why do we need Analytics?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I answer the question, let me brief you with some of the problems and their solutions in R in multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large amount of customer data is generated everyday in Banks. While dealing with millions of customers on regular basis, it becomes hard to track their mortgages.\n",
    "R builds a custom model that maintains the loans provided to every individual customer which helps us to decide the amount to be paid by the customer over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insurance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance extensively depends on forecasting. It is difficult to decide which policy to accept or reject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "By  using the continuous credit report as input, we can create a model in R that will not only assess risk appetite but also make a predictive forecast as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Healthcare:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year millions of people are admitted in hospital and billions are spent annually just in the admission process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the patient history and medical history, a predictive model can be built to identify who is at risk for hospitalization and to what extent the medical equipment should be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how data analytics helps organizations to harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. If we talk about the need for analytics in an organization, you must come across these 4 aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Cost Reduction</li>\n",
    "    <li>Better Marketing and Product analysis       </li>\n",

    "    <li> Faster Better Decision Making </li>\n",

    "    \n",
    "# What is Business Analytics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Business analytics is a process of examining large sets of data and achieving hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. It basically helps you understand all the data that you have gathered, be it organisational data, market or product research data or any other kind of data. It becomes easy for you to make better decisions, better products, better marketing strategies etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Data visualization: \n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is a visual access to huge amounts of data that you have generated after analytics. The human mind processes visual images and visual graphics are more better than compare to raw data. Its always easy for us to understand a pie chart or a bar graph compare to raw numbers. Now you may be wondering how can you achieve this data visualization from the data you have already analyzed?\n",

    "R is simple and easy to learn, read and write.\n",
